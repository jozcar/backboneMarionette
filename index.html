        <h4>About</h4>
        Nowadays there many JavaScript frameworks that all promise you faster web development, which it might be true to some extend but at the expense of your personal life.  In other words, you have to put in the hours trying to learn these frameworks.  However, I don’t think that developers need to spend hours trying to figure out if a framework is ideal for them, all you really need is to view a piece of sample code of some common task, and figure out immediately if this is something that you are willing to spend some time learning it.
        Most of the tutorial out there, give you a lot of information with very basic samples that are often impractical for real web development.
        My goal for this site, is to create meaningful samples of some common task in web development using different frameworks, and providing the solution with the code.  The idea is to make your appetite grow by looking at the code or lose it if you don’t like what you see.
        
        <br /><br />The samples that I will be posting belong to the JS framework Marionette.  Most of these samples were created by following a book called "Marionette js, A Gentle Introduction", I will not bore you with the history,I will leave this task to you.
